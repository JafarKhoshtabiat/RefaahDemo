break the app into 3 flows: 
   - Loading&Status
   - Registration
   - Login

each flow consists of several screens. by breaking this screens into small models, views and controllers, it's possible to refrence any issue or possible bug in a few moments. ofcourse models, views or controllers that can be reused, must be restructured so they fit in the abstracttion of this context.
